# Chapter 1

Call me Ishmael.
Because that is my name.
My name, as I said, is Ishmael.

# Chapter 3

Ishmael picks up a dagger.
In the distance, Ishmael saw a person sitting on the side of the road.
When he approached, the person said, “You look like the perfect hero to fight the dragon, Drago.”
“Sure,” said Ishmael, agreeably, “If I knew how, I would!”
And so the person (who was named Frankie, by the way) trained Ishmael in how to fight Drago.

# Chapter 7

“Adieu, Allie”, said Ishmael.
“Ciaozers, Ishmael,” said Allie.
And so they departed.
