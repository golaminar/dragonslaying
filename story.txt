# Chapter 1

Call me Ishmael.
Because that is my name.
My name, as I said, is Ishmael.
I have just woken up, and am doing what I do every day: introducing myself to unseen, unheard, unknowable listeners.

# Chapter 3

Ishmael picks up a dagger.
In the distance, Ishmael saw a person sitting on the side of the road.
When he approached, the person said, “You look like the perfect hero to fight the dragon, Drago.”
“Sure,” said Ishmael, agreeably, “If I knew how, I would!”
And so the person (who was named Frankie, by the way) trained Ishmael in how to fight Drago.

# Chapter 4

Fast forward, and they are in the entrance to the dragon Drago’s lair, where a servant of the dragon, Drago, is standing.
Ishmael draws his dagger, and the servant draws a picture of a cat.
They battle!
Ishmael loses, but the servant lets them pass anyway.

# Chapter 7

“Adieu, Allie”, said Ishmael.
“Ciaozers, Ishmael,” said Allie, “Take this sword.”
And so they departed.

# Chapter 8

I, Ishmael, have returned home.
When I awoke this morning, the world was a static place, but now I see it differently.
Now, the world is dynamic.
So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.
