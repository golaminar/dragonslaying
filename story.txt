# chapter 1

call me ishmael.
because that is my name.
so it goes.
my name, as i said, is ishmael.
i have just woken up to a clear blue sky, and am doing what i do every day: introducing myself to unseen, unheard, unknowable listeners.

# chapter 2

i turned on my red radio.
“a dragon name drago has been terrorizing our city!” declared the local radio newscaster.
so it goes.
my cat kitty stretched.

# chapter 3

ishmael picks up a blue dagger, in the distance, ishmael saw a person sitting on the side of the road.
when he approached, the person said, “you look like the perfect hero to fight the dragon, drago.”
so it goes.
“sure,” said ishmael, agreeably, “if i knew how, i would!”
and so the person (who was named frankie, by the way) trained ishmael in how to fight drago.

# chapter 4

fast forward, and they are in the entrance to the dragon drago’s lair, where a servant of the dragon, drago, is standing.
ishmael draws his blue dagger, and the servant draws a picture of a cat, which reminds ishmael of kitty.
so it goes.
they battle!
ishmael loses, but the servant lets them pass anyway.

# chapter 7

“adieu, allie”, said ishmael.
“ciaozers, ishmael,” said allie, “take this red sword.”
so it goes.
and so they departed.

# chapter 8

i, ishmael, have returned home, where kitty greets me by turning her back and walking away.
when i awoke this morning, the world was a static place, but now i see it differently.
so it goes.
now, the world is dynamic, flashing colours of red, green, and blue.
so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.
